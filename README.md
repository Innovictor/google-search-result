The Odin Project's Difficult Version: Build the Google.com search results page
I am trying to recreate  the difficult version pf The Odin Project's Build the Google.com search results page using HTML and CSS.
I'll be using much of the code from the easy version of the Google Search Homepage that I created earlier.
Please note that the links probably leads to nowhere and forms wonâ€™t submit. 
The main focus here is on the placement and order of items on the page.

Note to self: Don't give up
